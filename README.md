# Breakout-Game
A version of the game break out, made only in java using java swing and jPanel. The paddle is controlled using left and right arrow keys. The main method is held in the Game class. A score is tracked for each run, with each brick being worth 100 points. A level is also tracked, starting with level 1, after all bricks are cleared the game board resets and a new level begins. The speed of the ball and paddle increase each level and every 5 levels the width of the paddle decreases in order to make the game increasingly more difficult. The minimum paddle width is 60. Each level after the first, the background color is set to a new random color, though all of these colors will be dark so that all game elements are easily visible.
